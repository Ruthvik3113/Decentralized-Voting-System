**Decentralized Voting System**

Welcome to the Decentralized Voting System GitHub repository! This project aims to revolutionize the voting process by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and tamper-proofness in elections. 

**Project Overview:**

The Decentralized Voting System consists of two main subsystems: Admin Login and Voter Login. Each subsystem serves a specific role in facilitating the voting process:

1. **Admin Panel:**
   - Register and remove candidates.
   - Register and validate voters.
   - Start and stop the election campaign.
   - Calculate statistics such as the number of votes, number of voters, winners, and their respective votes.

2. **Voter Interface:**
   - Seamless UI allowing voters to easily search and vote for their preferred candidate from a comprehensive list.
   - Voters have a straightforward task: to cast their votes securely and conveniently.

**Key Features:**

- Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency and tamper-proofness throughout the voting process.
- Implements smart contracts in Solidity for secure and immutable execution of voting operations.
- Seamless integration with the Thirdweb framework for frontend-backend communication.
- Utilizes Ethereum blockchain and Sepolia test network for testing and deployment.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
- React.js for building interactive user interfaces.
- Solidity programming language for smart contract development.
- Ethereum blockchain for decentralized and secure data storage.
- Sepolia test network for testing and validating the system's functionality.

**How Blockchain Technology is Utilized:**

- **Transparency:** Every action within the voting system, from candidate registration to vote counting, is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency in the entire process.
  
- **Security:** Utilizing blockchain technology enhances the security of the voting system by making it resistant to tampering or unauthorized access.
  
- **Immutability:** Once recorded on the blockchain, data cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the voting records.
